# Organization Charter
## Team Goals

The team has shared goals that reflect a successful product with regard to EGR314. These goals are as follows:
* As a team we want to use this product design experience to further our future careers. 
* We may improve our standing in the industry and create prospects for progress by iteratively enhancing the product in response to feedback.

## Communication Channels & Procedures
_Table 2: Team Member Communication Modes_

|Name|Saif Elsaady|Colin Fricke|Carrie Greeney|Todd Hayes|
|----|------------|------------|--------------|----------|
|First Choice Communication|Text messages|Text messages|Text messages|Text messages|
|Second Choice Communication|Discord|Discord|Discord|Discord|
|Third Choice Communication|Gmail|Gmail|Gmail|Gmail|

   The team will communicate using a text message group chat for asynchronous discussion. This method is most effective as each individual is active on their cell phone which means that they will be able to check their messages more often, leading to better communication. The team will communicate through scheduled Discord meetings for discussions as it is the best possible way to communicate synchronously whilst respecting each other’s schedules and commitments. As a group we will handle instructor correspondence by assigning a person as a primary point of contact to the instructor, Dr. Nichols. This person will be responsible for distributing all information between the instructor and the team members.

**Methods of Group Communication**
1. Group Text
2. Discord
3. Email

   Based on the above table, the largest blocks of time that all four team members are available are 12:00-3:00pm on Sunday and 3:00-7:00pm on Saturday. This can be adjusted throughout the semester as needed. We can also have a smaller number of team members meet if a deadline is near and not everyone is available.

   The team decided that everyone will have reminders set on their cellular device or google calendars to remind them of the weekly meetings. The team will utilize text communication as a group in order to communicate any future meeting time changes or additional meeting time adjustments. The preferred format of the meeting is a virtual discord call or meeting during office hours. The team believes that there are no other necessary procedures. 

## Roles & Responsibilities
_Table 3: Project Roles and Duties_
|Name|Role|Duties|
|-|-|-|
|Saif Elsaady|Meeting leader|Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting|
|Colin Fricke|Meeting recorder|Takes minutes of each meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned|
|Carrie Greeney|Assignment leader|Coordinates the team’s work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date|
|Todd Hayes|Project monitor|Tracks the team’s progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status|

   Project roles will stay as they are unless the group decides that a team member is not fulfilling their duties outlined by that role. We self-assigned into each role to begin with. If a team member gets removed from a role, a different team member can volunteer or we can agree as a group on who to elect as a replacement. Each team member will take care of their own responsibilities first, then help out team members if they have more work to do or are falling behind. If the team has to adjust roles we will do so during a meeting so that everyone is on the same page and knows who is in the new roles. We will track the team’s progress by keeping track of the deadlines and the project monitor will help make sure everyone stays on track to finish by the deadline date. The team leader will be in charge of assigning technical responsibilities that do not already fall into a specific team member's duties. 

## Team Coordination & Accountability
   Ensure that assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has reviewed each assignment before submission. The team will work on completing these assignments before the deadlines by communicating with each other on how and what each team member will be completing in the respective assignment. The team will discuss through text messages their level of contentment with the final form of the assignment and then “sign off” as a group on the assignment before it is submitted. The team will discuss with one another the skills and knowledge each person possesses for each assignment and ensure that every team member is comfortable with the work at hand. If a team member is not comfortable with the work at hand, a more experienced team member will work with them so that they are able to develop the knowledge and skills required to complete the assignment. The team will ensure that feedback from the design review is distributed to and acted on by every member of the team by discussing thoughts and concerns through the text message chat.

   As a team we will address missed contributions, assignments, and actions by discussing them with one another and communicating why the mistakes were made and how they can be avoided in the future. The team will discuss the situation and take appropriate action depending on the situation. The team will hold each other accountable by keeping track of the mistakes, and lack of effort shown towards the group work. The team will do this by calling out one another to do better, and understanding that the instructor will be informed if a particular standard of effort is not met. The team will recognize that a team member is underperforming by observing the lack of effort shown towards an assignment, lack of communication in a discussion, and lack of presence in classes, as well as scheduled meetings and speaking directly with them about any issues that arise. The team will help an underperforming team member improve by asking them what they are struggling with, offer them help and guidance on the particular matter, and work with them as a team to track their progress and meet the particular group standard. The consequences of an underperforming team member not improving is a pink slip.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution
   The team will absolutely acknowledge a disagreement when it occurs. The team understands that each one of us will have opinions that differ from time to time, and will successfully reach a middle ground whenever a disagreement occurs because it is crucial to the success of the team. The team will avoid situations where a conflict of interest arises and will work on evenly distributing roles, and assignments, as well as a high level of communication that will ensure the best possible outcome for the team. The team will work on resolving conflicts as soon as they arise in order to get the best possible solution. The team will follow the protocol discussed under Team Coordination & Accountability to limit conflicts. The team determined that a problem should be escalated to the instructor when it starts hindering team performance, as well as when particular members have work overload due to the lack of effort shown by a team member.

**Generative AI Disclosure**

The team did not use AI in this assignment as it was a team organization charter. We thought it would be more effective to have these discussions and make these decisions without using AI.
