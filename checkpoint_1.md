   The team will communicate using a text message group chat for asynchronous discussion. This method is most effective as each individual is active on their cell phone which means that they will be able to check their messages more often, leading to better communication. The team will communicate through scheduled Discord meetings for discussions as it is the best possible way to communicate synchronously whilst respecting each other’s schedules and commitments. As a group we will handle instructor correspondence by assigning a person as a primary point of contact to the instructor, Dr. Nichols. This person will be responsible for distributing all information between the instructor and the team members.

**Methods of Group Communication**
1. Group Text
2. Discord
3. Email

   Based on the above table, the largest blocks of time that all four team members are available are 12:00-3:00pm on Sunday and 3:00-7:00pm on Saturday. This can be adjusted throughout the semester as needed. We can also have a smaller number of team members meet if a deadline is near and not everyone is available.

   The team decided that everyone will have reminders set on their cellular device or google calendars to remind them of the weekly meetings. The team will utilize text communication as a group in order to communicate any future meeting time changes or additional meeting time adjustments. The preferred format of the meeting is a virtual discord call or meeting during office hours. The team believes that there are no other necessary procedures. 

## Roles & Responsibilities
_Table 3: Project Roles and Duties_

|Name|Role|Duties|
|-|-|-|
|Saif Elsaady|Meeting leader|Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting|
|Colin Fricke|Meeting recorder|Takes minutes of each meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned|
|Carrie Greeney|Assignment leader|Coordinates the team’s work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date|
|Todd Hayes|Project monitor|Tracks the team’s progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status|

   Project roles will stay as they are unless the group decides that a team member is not fulfilling their duties outlined by that role. We self-assigned into each role to begin with. If a team member gets removed from a role, a different team member can volunteer or we can agree as a group on who to elect as a replacement. Each team member will take care of their own responsibilities first, then help out team members if they have more work to do or are falling behind. If the team has to adjust roles we will do so during a meeting so that everyone is on the same page and knows who is in the new roles. We will track the team’s progress by keeping track of the deadlines and the project monitor will help make sure everyone stays on track to finish by the deadline date. The team leader will be in charge of assigning technical responsibilities that do not already fall into a specific team member's duties. 

## Team Coordination & Accountability
   Ensure that assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has reviewed each assignment before submission. The team will work on completing these assignments before the deadlines by communicating with each other on how and what each team member will be completing in the respective assignment. The team will discuss through text messages their level of contentment with the final form of the assignment and then “sign off” as a group on the assignment before it is submitted. The team will discuss with one another the skills and knowledge each person possesses for each assignment and ensure that every team member is comfortable with the work at hand. If a team member is not comfortable with the work at hand, a more experienced team member will work with them so that they are able to develop the knowledge and skills required to complete the assignment. The team will ensure that feedback from the design review is distributed to and acted on by every member of the team by discussing thoughts and concerns through the text message chat.

   As a team we will address missed contributions, assignments, and actions by discussing them with one another and communicating why the mistakes were made and how they can be avoided in the future. The team will discuss the situation and take appropriate action depending on the situation. The team will hold each other accountable by keeping track of the mistakes, and lack of effort shown towards the group work. The team will do this by calling out one another to do better, and understanding that the instructor will be informed if a particular standard of effort is not met. The team will recognize that a team member is underperforming by observing the lack of effort shown towards an assignment, lack of communication in a discussion, and lack of presence in classes, as well as scheduled meetings and speaking directly with them about any issues that arise. The team will help an underperforming team member improve by asking them what they are struggling with, offer them help and guidance on the particular matter, and work with them as a team to track their progress and meet the particular group standard. The consequences of an underperforming team member not improving is a pink slip.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution
   The team will absolutely acknowledge a disagreement when it occurs. The team understands that each one of us will have opinions that differ from time to time, and will successfully reach a middle ground whenever a disagreement occurs because it is crucial to the success of the team. The team will avoid situations where a conflict of interest arises and will work on evenly distributing roles, and assignments, as well as a high level of communication that will ensure the best possible outcome for the team. The team will work on resolving conflicts as soon as they arise in order to get the best possible solution. The team will follow the protocol discussed under Team Coordination & Accountability to limit conflicts. The team determined that a problem should be escalated to the instructor when it starts hindering team performance, as well as when particular members have work overload due to the lack of effort shown by a team member.

|“Installation was easy, and the mounting bracket, arm, and base give you lots of options for horizontal or vertical, on either a flat surface or on a pole. Since we had the last one up high on a pole above the fence, we did the same thing here as it worked out very easily. The base unit readout screen is nice, good contrast, lots of information on it, more than we had on the last one. It hasn't rained yet, so we haven't seen how that works yet, but the rest of it has been effective, in comparison to our neighbors and some other readouts we have available nearby. Since we got this on the recent Prime Day at a nice sale price, it was a great deal and fantastic bargain.”|Easy-to-read display (Explicit): The reviewer appreciates the contrast and the amount of information on the display.|Quick setup process (Explicit): The ease of installation and the versatility of the mounting options are highlighted.|
|“There are a great number of weather stations on the market that provide a varying range of data. Finding one that targets what you need can be daunting if not exhausting by the time you do all the research. Keep in mind that any weather station won’t stand a chance of providing accurate data if you don’t follow the instructions. The user manual provided sufficient details (and pictures) to make the installation easy. We were up and running with a connection to an online weather channel within an hour.”|Detailed user manual (Explicit): The reviewer values the detailed instructions and pictures in the user manual that facilitated easy installation.|Wireless data transmission (Explicit): They mention the ability to connect to an online weather channel, indicating the importance of this feature.|
|“I got a Sainlogic WS0835 weather station for Christmas. I read the book before setting it up and was somewhat intimidated. I took it page by page as I set it up, and it was super easy. Basically put the proper batteries in each half then set the date and time on the console and let her rip. Put up the outdoor sensor part using a compass to orient the solar panel correctly and you’re done. It does not connect to the internet. It just relays real time data. There are steps for calibration if you're super picky into wanting exact wind speeds etc., but if you're like me and just want general info, it’s pretty accurate as is. As a backup I watched 3 introductory YouTube videos by reviewers just to make sure I didn’t miss anything. Nope. It really is that easy. One reviewer was a waste of time. One was “ok”, and one was pretty good. I am really enjoying this product. Especially the use of different colors for the different measurements.”|Real-time data updates (Explicit): The reviewer enjoys the real-time data relay, despite the lack of internet connectivity.|Easy-to-read display (Explicit): The mention of different colors for different measurements suggests that the display’s readability and user-friendliness are appreciated.|

|I purchased the unit for my 70 acre farm where I have an orchard of 80+ trees plus bees and some livestock. It's very important to me to monitor rainfall so I can decide if I need to irrigate and provide supplemental water sources for the bees and animals. Sainlogic worked great for the first few months. The temperature readings, wind speed/direction and rain gauge appeared to be accurate. A couple weeks ago we had a big weather front move through and I noticed the rain gauge showed 0" of rain. I thought maybe the rain gauge needed cleaning so I followed the instructions for cleaning (it wasn't very dirty) and was hoping that the problem was solved. Unfortunately, it wasn't. A large storm front is passing through as I speak. The wind gauge works, the temperature works and everything else works except the most important function (for me). No rainfall is being measured|Accurate rain measurement (Explicit): The reviewer emphasizes the importance of accurately measuring rainfall for irrigation purposes.|Low maintenance requirements (Explicit): The difficulty experienced with cleaning and maintaining the rain gauge, especially the battery replacement process, indicates the need for a design with low maintenance.|
|Had to change batteries today. Not designed by Germans I can tell you that. I ended up just having to remove it from the mount so I could get the TINY screw out. I'm old, fat and lazy, changing the batteries should NOT have required the amount of effort it did. I replaced the retarded screw with Gorilla tape. It'll actually be MORE water proof that way. To save yourself some time (if you buy it), look at pic 5 for the microscopic screwdriver size you need. If I recall it's an eyeglass repair set, so the size is starred.|Long battery life (Explicit): The frustration with having to frequently change batteries suggests the need for long-lasting battery life.|Easy maintenance and battery replacement (Explicit): The difficulties in changing the batteries and the need for a small screwdriver point towards a need for simpler maintenance procedures.|
|This weather station worked for a couple of months, then stopped transmitting the outside temperature, wind speed and rainfall. We changed the batteries, went out and bought expensive lithium batteries and the reset button on the unit stayed red, never green like it’s supposed to be! It worked long enough for it to no longer be covered by Amazon or its seller. As a matter of fact, it doesn’t even come with a warranty! So I again, urge you not to WASTE your money!|Reliable long-term operation (Explicit): The weather station stopped working correctly after a few months, indicating the need for reliable and durable performance over time.|Warranty and service options (Explicit): The lack of warranty coverage and the product failing outside the Amazon return window highlight the need for better warranty and customer service support.|

|“One additional comment to add to my review below. After writing this I started noticing some issues with the sensor briefly but regularly dropping the connection to the base at night. I called AW and the person who handles return issues answered the phone. With nothing more than a brief description of the issue and assurance that I was using fresh batteries she simply said she would send another sensor out right away. It works flawlessly. Yet another aspect of AW I am more than impressed with - super easy to work with and easy product support and a company that stands by their warranty.”|Robust technical support (Latent): The reviewer's positive experience with customer service and the easy resolution of their issue highlight the need for effective technical support.|Reliable wireless connectivity (Explicit): The issue with the sensor dropping the connection to the base station underscores the importance of reliable wireless connectivity.|
|“I’ve wanted to get a web-connected weather station for a long time. And wanted an Alexa compatible one. I hesitated on this particular one because it had fewer reviews, but then I realized that’s because it’s a brand-new model—it hasn’t had time to collect hundreds of reviews yet. This is my first weather station and I really like it. It worked quickly right out of the box, showing data on its console. And I immediately hooked it up to the Ambient internet-based data site which provides a very clear web-based portrayal of your current weather data and great historical data graphs. Really well done. Later I also hooked the 2901 up to weatherunderground.com, but I think the Ambient site is better for viewing your weather data.”|Integration with smart home devices (Latent): The desire for Alexa compatibility indicates a need for integration with smart home ecosystems.|Data sharing options (Latent): The reviewer's appreciation for the ability to connect to different web-based platforms for weather data indicates a preference for versatile data sharing and viewing options.|
|“I researched weather stations prior to purchasing this one and I have to say that I'm impressed by the build quality, the instructions and how easy it is to put this weather station together. There are very few parts to put the station together and get it operational and the instructions are written clearly and in depth.Contrary to the complaints of others regarding a dim hard to read screen I found this screen was brightly lit and the viewing angle with the stand made it very easy to see.”|Easy-to-read display (Explicit): The reviewer's mention of a brightly lit screen with a good viewing angle addresses the need for an easily readable display.|Quick setup process (Explicit): The reviewer's positive experience with the straightforward assembly and clear instructions highlights the importance of a quick and easy setup process.|

|“If all you want is the weather data from your yard, then perhaps this Ambient WS-2902 station will work for you. If you want to have that data available via a WiFi/Internet connection, this weather station is AWFUL. Perhaps all those Amazon positive reviews are from purchasers who don't own phones or tablets, so they never need to consider the possibilities of connecting with the Ambient. You will grow old and miserable trying to get this station's console to communicate via WiFi, on a phone or tablet. Forget the fantasy that you might have your weather data at your fingertips wherever you are in the world. Read the Amazon one-star reviews for an idea of how difficult it will be to connect to WiFi.”|Reliable wireless connectivity (Explicit): The frustration with connecting the weather station to WiFi highlights the need for reliable and easy-to-use wireless connectivity.|Remote monitoring capabilities (Latent): The reviewer's expectation of accessing weather data from anywhere in the world points to the need for effective remote monitoring features|
|“I really wanted to like the Ambient Weather WS-2902b weather station, but after going through two displays and several discussions with customer service, this is probably not the company you want to spend either your time or money dealing with. Issues: The display unit received with the station had an unreadable, dim display when viewed straight on (like you would view it if it was mounted to a wall). See photo #1 for straight on view and photo #2 for the stand angle. Using the included display stand, which tilts the unit to the rear, it’s even worse, with the display fading out completely. See photo #3 for the view tilted back as it appears if using the plastic stand).”|Easy-to-read display (Explicit): The issue with the dim and unreadable display, especially when mounted, directly relates to the need for a clear and easily visible display.|Robust technical support (Latent): The dissatisfaction with customer service interactions underlines the importance of responsive and helpful technical support.|
|“So, I purchased this for my father, who recently passed away. I decided to take it and set it up at my house because we used to love to chat about the weather. The "buttons" are just bad, touch sensitive membrane keys. If you accidentally hit the set button, it will display the mac address of the unit. Now if you are a network engineer by trade (as I am) this is nice, but it is not at all clear how to get back to the normal display (hint it will revert after about 30 seconds or so) via the device itself. The WIFI setup is the stuff of nightmares.”|User-friendly interface (Explicit): The difficulties with touch-sensitive buttons and navigating the display settings indicate a need for a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.|Simplified WiFi setup (Explicit): The reviewer's challenges with the WiFi setup process, described as a nightmare, emphasize the importance of a straightforward and easy WiFi configuration.|

|“I needed to replace my present remote weather station, and I thought a color display would be easier to read than the older B&W unit. NOPE! The color combinations on this unit for numerals and background make it much more difficult to read. The indoor temperature is dark green numbers on a darker green background, The outdoor temperature is dark red numbers on a darker red background. At least the rain gauge (which, by the way, doesn't work at all) is a mostly readable two-tone light blue number on a dark blue background. The wind speed, direction, barometric pressure and time/date is a pale white on a light gray background, which is not that much better for reading.”|Easy-to-read display (Explicit): The difficulty in reading the display due to poor color combinations directly relates to the need for a clearly readable display.|Accurate rain measurement (Explicit): The non-functioning rain gauge highlights the importance of reliable and accurate rain measurement capabilities.|
|“I purchased just under 3 months ago and the site that tracks all of the outdoor info keeps saying error. I'm not going to keep climbing onto the roof of my 2 story house to continue resetting the sensor in the middle of winter for it to only last for a week before saying error again. I've even tried multiple batteries to no avail. Missed my return window. Buyer beware.”|Reliable long-term operation (Explicit): The recurring error messages and the need for frequent resets indicate a need for dependable and consistent performance over time.|Easy maintenance and battery replacement (Explicit): The challenges with accessing the sensor for battery replacement and maintenance underscore the need for more accessible maintenance solutions.|
|“The display is easy to read, but controlling the display is not intuitive; you have to read the manual to figure out how to change the display (e.g. it defaults to current rainfall, but to get accumulated rainfall you have to change the display.) If you put the weather station up where there are obstructions (e.g. trees or buildings taller than the weather station) you will not get an accurate wind direction and speed. Similarly, after a windstorm, it seems that windblown debris clogged the rain gauge and it stopped working. The problems with surrounding objects being higher than the weather station leads to difficulty installing it: if you put it on a tall enough pole to try to get above surrounding obstructions, it can then be too tall to see the compass orientation indicator for pointing the station in the right direction for accurately determining the wind direction and equally hard to reach the top of the station to place a level on it so the wind speed meter and rain gauge accurately measure the wind speed and rainfall. On the plus side, the radio transmitter to the display device works flawlessly over a long distance with stucco and plaster walls in between the two units.”|User-friendly interface (Explicit): The difficulty in intuitively controlling the display and needing to refer to the manual suggests a need for a more user-friendly interface.|Installation flexibility (Latent): The challenges in installing the weather station at an appropriate height to avoid obstructions and accurately measure environmental data underscore the need for flexible installation options that can accommodate various environments.|

|“It's a nice design but way too delicate for doing anything remotely outdoorsy. I used this bag once to keep extra clothes, towels, and my phone dry while on a fishing trip. The bag sat in a locker on the boat (24 foot center console) for about 12 hours or so through moderate (2-3 foot) seas on the Chesapeake Bay and by the end of the trip the bottom of the bag had a hole worn through it from rubbing against the fiberglass deck. This thing didn't last a day in a locker, out of the sun, and away from sharp objects, so I can't imagine how long it would be expected to work if you actually went anywhere with rocks or trees or literally anything else that could possibly poke or rub a hole into it.”|Durability and ruggedness (Explicit): The bag's inability to withstand even moderate conditions without getting damaged indicates a need for more durable and rugged construction.|Resistance to abrasion (Explicit): The hole worn through the bottom of the bag from rubbing against the deck highlights the need for resistance to abrasion and wear.|
